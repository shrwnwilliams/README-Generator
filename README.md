# Description
This is the final version of my in-terminal ReadMe.md generator. The user, when running node index.js in their terminal, will be prompted with several questions, the answers of which will be placed in the corresponding locations in a ReadMe.md file. The title of the ReadMe will be the same as the project title. Depending on which license type the user chooses, a badge will be created and placed on top of the ReadMe. If the user chooses not to include a license, the license section will not be included anywhere in the ReadMe.
